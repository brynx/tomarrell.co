Personal Website/Blog
============
##Outdated. Please see tomarrellcom repo for current personal site source.

My personal website and development blog.

A single page site with social media icons below the fold and large hero image above. Main heading colors randomized on refresh. Built with integration to a Ghost blog.

Currently obsolete as work is underway building an updated version using ChangeCMS, a personal project to build a fully featured NodeJS CMS. Head over to https://github.com/tomarrell/ChangeCMS, feel free to fork and contribute.
