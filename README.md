Personal Website/Blog
============

My personal website and development blog.

A simple single page site with social media icons below the fold. Main heading colors randomized on refresh. Built with integration to a Ghost blog.

Currently obsolete as work is underway building an updated version using ChangeCMS, a personal project to build a fully featured NodeJS CMS. Head over to https://github.com/tomarrell/ChangeCMS, feel free to fork and contribute.
